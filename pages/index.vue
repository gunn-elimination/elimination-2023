            At the beginning of the game (1/27/23, 12:00 A.M.), each player will be assigned another player (target). Your
            mission is to eliminate your target by tagging them with a miniature stuffed plushie. After you eliminate your
            first target, you will get assigned your target's target. Eliminations are only valid under certain circumstances
            (see below). The game will end on 2/10/23 at 11:59 PM and whoever has the most kills by then wins!
